# 🎯 AI Builder Prompt: Feenix: Amkadamiyya School Fee Management System

## 📖 The Problem Statement: Why We Need This Software

**The Current Chaos at Amkadamiyya School**

Amkadamiyya School Jalingo has been managing student fees the old-fashioned way: **spreadsheets**. Excel files scattered across desks, shared via email, updated manually, prone to errors. Here's the painful reality:

- **Lost data**: Rows deleted by accident, versions overwritten, no audit trail
- **Manual calculations**: Balancing sheets takes hours, arithmetic mistakes = angry parents
- **No visibility**: Finance staff doesn't know who owes what until end-of-term reconciliation (too late)
- **Payment chaos**: Multiple payment methods (cash, bank transfers, mobile money) logged separately, hard to reconcile
- **Paper receipts**: Printed receipts get lost; parents call asking "did you record my payment?"
- **Reports take forever**: Need a debtor list? Admin spends a day filtering and sorting
- **Communication breakdown**: School can't easily contact defaulters; guardians don't get payment reminders
- **Audit nightmare**: Zero compliance trail; difficult to verify who approved what payment

**Why This Matters**

Every day without proper system:
- Administrative staff waste 4-5 hours on manual data entry and reconciliation
- The Director can't make strategic decisions (no real-time data)
- Parents get frustrated with unclear payment statuses
- The school loses track of outstanding fees (estimated 15-20% revenue loss)
- Staff morale drops (repetitive, error-prone work)

**The Solution**

This software replaces chaos with clarity. A modern, intuitive fee management system that:
- **Centralizes data**: Single source of truth for all student payments and balances
- **Automates calculations**: Real-time balance updates, automatic receipt generation
- **Enables insights**: Dashboards show collection rates, debtor trends, class-wise analysis
- **Improves communication**: Easy contact to guardians, payment reminders, reconciliation reports
- **Ensures compliance**: Full audit trail, role-based access, secure data
- **Saves time**: Staff focuses on strategy, not spreadsheets

## Project Overview

Build a **production-ready React frontend** for a school fee management system that replaces Excel spreadsheets with a modern, intuitive web interface. This is for Amkadamiyya School Jalingo. Generate **ONLY React pages and reusable components**—no backend code, no Radix UI, no shadcn.

---

## 🎨 Design System

### Color Palette

Use the following CSS variables as the single source of truth for colors across the app:

```css
:root {
    --primary: #5f81c2;
    --secondary: #e2ecfe;
    --white: #e7ebf9;
    --black: #080e18;
    --gray: #c1c4cb;
    --bg-body: #f2f3f6;
    /* School Category Colors */
    --cat-nursery: #4d7ae8; /* blue */
    --cat-primary: #8b5cf6; /* purple */
    --cat-junior: #ea5cbf; /* magenta/pink */
    --cat-senior: #f59e0b; /* amber */
}
```

- Primary: brand color (`--primary`)
- Secondary: light variant (`--secondary`)
- Neutrals: `--white`, `--black`, `--gray`

All UI components, utilities, and charts should reference these variables directly (or via Tailwind tokens mapped to them) instead of hardcoded hex values.

### Typography

- **Font**: Figtree
- **Headings**: 600-700 weight, navy color
- **Body**: 400-500 weight, gray color
- **Currency/Numbers**: 600 weight, larger sizing

### Visual Style

- Clean cards with 12px radius, multi-layered subtle shadows
- Icons everywhere (input fields, cards, etc): Heroicons
- Generous spacing (24-32px padding)
- Currency format: ₦ (Naira symbol)
- Smooth Framer Motion animations throughout
- Tables are permitted for high-density data (Students master table, mini debtors summary on Dashboard). Prefer card grids elsewhere.
- Skeleton loaders for all data-loading states (tables, cards, charts, modals, lists) for perceived performance.
- Skeleton loaders for all data-loading states (tables, cards, charts, modals, lists) for perceived performance.

---

## 🏗️ Tech Stack

**Required**:

- React Router v6
- Tailwind CSS (custom config with above palette)
- **Heroicons** (all icons)
- **Framer Motion** (all animations)

### Admin

- Add/edit students (no delete)
- Record payments, configure fees, view reports

### Accountant

**Features**: Responsive (collapses to cards on <640px), sortable headers, optional row selection, sticky header, empty state slot.
**Styling**: Use CSS variables; header background `--secondary`, hover row background `--secondary` at 30% opacity, focus outline with `--primary`.
**Accessibility**: `role="table"` with proper `th` scope; rows keyboard focusable; phone numbers inside cells use `href="tel:"`.

## 🎬 Animation Strategy

**Use Framer Motion for**:

- Page transitions (fade + slide)
- List/grid stagger (children delay)
- Card hover effects (lift + shadow)
- Modal/drawer animations (scale + backdrop fade)
- Button interactions (tap scale, hover lift)
- Success states (checkmark draw, confetti explosion)
- Loading states (spinner rotation, skeleton pulse)
- Form elements (input focus ring, error shake)
- Tab/accordion transitions
- Chart data updates
- Toast notifications (slide + fade)

**General principles**:

- Spring physics for natural feel
- 0.3s duration for most transitions
- Stagger children with 0.05s delay
- Hover: subtle lift + scale (1.02)
- Tap: scale down (0.98)
- Exits: reverse of entry animations

---

## 📱 Responsive Design

**Breakpoints**: Mobile (<640px), Tablet (640-1024px), Desktop (>1024px)

**Navigation Strategy**:

- **SM screens (<1024px)**: Bottom navigation bar with 3 primary items (Dashboard, Students, Payments) + 1 "More" button. "More" navigates to dedicated mobile-only Navigation Page (`/nav`) with grid layout showing all remaining routes (Debtors, Fee Structure, Reports, Settings, etc.) with icons, labels, and category color accents. Bottom nav remains visible on this page for quick return.
- **LG screens (≥1024px)**: Premium sidebar (collapsible, shows icons + labels when expanded) with all navigation items, persistent across pages. Topbar for global actions and user profile.

**Key adaptations**:

- Metric cards: 1-col mobile, 2-col tablet, 4-col desktop
- Student grid: 1-col mobile, 2-col tablet, 3-col desktop
- Forms: Single-col mobile, multi-col desktop
- Tables: Card layout mobile, table desktop
- Modals: Full-screen mobile, centered tablet/desktop

**Touch-friendly**: 44px minimum tap targets, 64px navigation items on mobile

---

## 🔒 Security & Validation

**Form validation** (React Hook Form):

- Real-time validation on blur
- Error messages below inputs (red)
- Required fields, email format, phone format, date ranges, unique admission numbers, amount validations

**Role-based rendering**: Conditionally show features based on user role

**Confirmation modals**: All destructive actions, large payments, bulk operations, type-to-confirm for critical actions
**Phone Links**: All guardian/user phone numbers rendered with `href="tel:"` for immediate calling on mobile devices; include visually hidden text for screen readers ("Call guardian").

---

## 📊 Utilities

**Formatters**: `formatCurrency(amount)`, `formatDate(date, format)`, `formatNumber(num)`, `formatPercent(decimal)`, `getInitials(name)`, `capitalizeWords(text)`

---

## 🎯 Key User Flows

1. **Record Payment**: Dashboard → Record Payment cmdbutton → Search student → Enter amount/method → Submit → Receipt
2. **Add Student**: Students → Add button → Fill form (grid, icons, no labels) → Save → Success toast
3. **Bulk Upload**: Students → Bulk Upload → Download template → Fill Excel → Upload → Map columns → Review → Import → Confetti
4. **View Debtors**: Debtors page → Filter by class/amount → Call guardian or record payment → Export PDF report
5. **Configure Fees**: Fee Structure → Create new → Select session/term/class → Add items → Save & apply → Generate invoices

---

## ✅ Final Requirements

- Production-ready code with proper error handling.
- Fully responsive (mobile-first)
- Smooth Framer Motion animations throughout
- Heroicons for all icons (no other icon libraries)
- Clean, reusable components
- TypeScript optional but encouraged
- Tailwind config with custom color palette
- Mock API integration ready (Axios setup with base URL)
- Comments for complex logic
- Accessible (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, focus management)

**Build a modern, intuitive interface that makes fee management feel effortless.**
